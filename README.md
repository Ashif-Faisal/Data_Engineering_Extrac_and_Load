# Data Engineering Extrac and Load

I have done an ETL project, where ETL means extract, transfer, and load. I extracted the data from a relational database and loaded it into another relational database. My source database is MySQL, and my target database is PostgreSQL.

According to my needs, from many tables in my source database, I extracted two tables through Python scripting, and after doing some transformations, I loaded them into my target database, Postgresql.
